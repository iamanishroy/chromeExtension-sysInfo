# sysInfo-chromeExtension

SysInfo-chromeExtension is a extension for chrome which is used to monitor system (CPU, memory and storage) information.

## Important

Currently, the ID of the chrome extension is temporary. So, I am using content_script to fill in the data of the PWA. Once we get a permanent ID we can migrate the content_script to the PWA.
